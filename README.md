# Object-detection-using-TensorFlow-Lite-
An Object identification model is prepared to identify the presence and area of different classes of articles. For instance, a model may be prepared with pictures that contain different bits of natural product, alongside a mark that indicates the class of organic product they address (for example an apple, a banana, or a strawberry), and information indicating where each item shows up in the picture.  At the point when a picture is along these lines given to the model, it will yield a rundown of the articles it identifies, the area of a bouncing box that contains each item, and a score that shows the certainty that discovery was right.
